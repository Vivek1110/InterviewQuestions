Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments 
and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument.
For example:
	const result = x => y => z => x + y + z; 
Above syntax has 3 sequence of functions.
This is normally written as (No curry syntax)
	const result = (x, y, z) => x + y + z;
