1. Spread:
	It is used in expanding the single varible into more, for example to array.

Example:
	var abc = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
	var def = ['d', 'e', 'f'];
	var alpha = [ ...abc, ...def ];
	The "..." indicates spread. And the output will be ['a', 'b', 'c','d', 'e', 'f']

2. Rest:
	The rest syntax is used to collapse the multiple arguments to one array. This is used when, number of argument for a function is not pre determined.
Example:
	function sum( first, ...others ) {
    		for ( var i = 0; i < others.length; i++ )
        	first += others[i];
    		return first;
	}

	Here "..." indicates spread. You can bass n number of arguments to the method sum.
